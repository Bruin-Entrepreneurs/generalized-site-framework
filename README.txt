Why Gatsby? 
* Gatsby aims to "construct higher-level web building blocks." 
  It aims to allow developers to construct modular components (using react)
  and use these in a static site. This fits our need well. 

* We can build a website from a default starter as outlined here:
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-one/

I first set up npm in the project
  npm init
Then I  installed gatsby, react, and react-dom:
  npm install gatsby react react-dom
Next I created a file that exported a basic react component (at src/pages)



I'm using styled components because they're sick. Coinbase and Twitch use them
